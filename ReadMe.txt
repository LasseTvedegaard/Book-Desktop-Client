BookBuddy

BookBuddy is a library program for storing your books and the information about each book. It consists of a desktopapp for administration of books, 
genres, location and employees. The plan is to add a website where users can create a userprofile, where they can make their own lists of 
books (Books they have read, books they want to read and books they are currently reading). The user should update the book they are currently 
reading everytime they have read in their book, to the page they are at now. When the book is finished the user adds the book to Have read-list.
The user can add books from the DB to the three lists.

This program is a distributed system that consists of an API that holds CRUD funktionality for Books, Genre, Location, Employee, User and Log. 
The program is still under development, Log are not implemented yet as well at the MVC.

This program is devloped by:
